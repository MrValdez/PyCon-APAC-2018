This is the slide presentation for my talk for PyCon APAC 2018.

My talk is called "Game Programming with Python" and I will be using pygame to show how to make a game.

These slides were created with the game programming library, Arcade. I used this library as a test if I should change game programming library. While I do enjoy Arcade, I do not have enough experience to use it for my live-coding.

There's a possibility there won't be audio during the event, so I may not be able to demonstrated playing sounds. But if you need to make sound effects, I recommend sfxr.
